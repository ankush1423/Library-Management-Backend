// 1. Create a Transaction
// Purpose: Create a new transaction when a borrower borrows or returns a book.
// Functionality:
// When a user borrows a book, create a new transaction.
// If a book is being returned, mark the transaction as completed and update relevant fields.
// Suggested Fields:
// Transaction Type (borrowed or returned).
// Borrower's ID and Book's ID.
// Date of Borrowing and Date of Return.
// Controller Example:

// createTransaction(req, res): Accepts bookId, userId, and transactionType as input, creates a transaction, and updates the related fields.
// 2. Get All Transactions
// Purpose: Retrieve all transactions made in the system.
// Functionality:
// Fetch a list of all transactions with details such as transaction type, book, borrower, and status.
// Optionally, allow filtering by bookId, userId, or status.
// Controller Example:

// getAllTransactions(req, res): Fetches all transactions from the database, with optional filtering and pagination.
// 3. Get Transactions by User
// Purpose: Retrieve all transactions of a specific borrower.
// Functionality:
// Fetch all transactions for a specific borrower, including borrowed, returned, and overdue books.
// Display the borrower's transaction history.
// Controller Example:

// getTransactionsByUser(req, res): Takes userId as input and returns a list of transactions for that user.
// 4. Get Overdue Transactions
// Purpose: Retrieve all overdue transactions for borrowed books.
// Functionality:
// Identify and return transactions where the dueDate has passed and the book is still marked as borrowed.
// Update the status to overdue if necessary.
// Controller Example:

// getOverdueTransactions(req, res): Filters transactions to return those where the status is borrowed and dueDate has passed.
// 5. Update Transaction Status (Mark as Returned)
// Purpose: Update the status of a transaction when a book is returned.
// Functionality:
// Mark the transaction as returned once the book is returned.
// Update the returnedDate, change the status to returned, and adjust the availableCopies of the book.
// Controller Example:

// updateTransactionStatus(req, res): Takes transactionId and marks it as returned, updating the relevant fields in the Transaction and Book models.
// 6. Delete a Transaction
// Purpose: Remove a transaction record from the database.
// Functionality:
// Delete a transaction in case of an error, or if the transaction is no longer needed.
// Controller Example:

// deleteTransaction(req, res): Takes transactionId as input and deletes the corresponding transaction from the database.
// 7. Handle Bulk Transactions (Borrow Multiple Books)
// Purpose: Handle multiple transactions at once (e.g., borrow multiple books at once).
// Functionality:
// Handle the borrowing of multiple books by the same user.
// Create separate transactions for each book.
// Controller Example:

// bulkCreateTransactions(req, res): Takes an array of books to be borrowed and creates individual transactions for each book.
// 8. Transaction History for Book
// Purpose: Retrieve the full transaction history for a specific book (e.g., when it was borrowed or returned).
// Functionality:
// Retrieve a list of transactions where the book was borrowed or returned.
// Controller Example:

// getTransactionHistoryForBook(req, res): Takes bookId and returns all associated transactions, including borrowing and returning actions.
// 9. Check Book's Availability for Borrowing (Using Transactions)
// Purpose: Check if a book is available for borrowing based on its transaction history.
// Functionality:
// Check if a book is currently borrowed or if it is available for borrowing.
// If the book is overdue or returned, update its availability status.
// Controller Example:

// checkBookAvailability(req, res): Takes bookId and returns whether the book can be borrowed based on current transactions.
// 10. Rollback a Transaction (if borrowing or returning failed)
// Purpose: Handle transaction rollbacks in case of failure during borrow or return operations.
// Functionality:
// If any part of the transaction fails (e.g., updating the Book and Borrower models), you can rollback the entire transaction to avoid data inconsistency.
// Controller Example:

// rollbackTransaction(req, res): Handles the rollback of a transaction if an error occurs during borrowing or returning operations.
